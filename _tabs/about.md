Hi, Iâ€™m Nelson! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to The Punch, my personal journal where I post writing, reviews, and snapshots.

I hold a Masterâ€™s in English Literature from Mercy University, with a background in English and a minor in Computer Science. My work frequently explores the intersections of technology, storytelling, and identity, particularly through digital publishing and student-led projects.

This space is for reflection, curiosity, and creative exploration, whether it's a book that evokes a strong emotion or a photo that captures a fleeting moment.

Feel free to explore â€” and thanks for stopping by. ðŸŒ±
